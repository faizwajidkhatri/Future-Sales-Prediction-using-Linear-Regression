# Future-Sales-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Predicting the future sales of a product helps a business manage the manufacturing and advertising cost of the product. There are many more benefits of predicting the future sales of a product. In this project, I will take you through the task of future sales prediction with machine learning using Python. and the algorithm used is Linear Regression
# Future Sales Prediction (Case Study)
The dataset given here contains the data about the sales of the product. The dataset is about the advertising cost incurred by the business on various advertising platforms. Below is the description of all the columns in the dataset:

1. TV: Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on TV;
